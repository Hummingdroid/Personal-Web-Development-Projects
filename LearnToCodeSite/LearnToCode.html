  <h3><em>....Become a programmer</em></h3>

  <p>
    When I first started to learn to code...scratch that, When I first looked into coding I thought why not.
    <br/> I mean, I loved how the technology that was portrayed in Science Fiction films was seemingly always coming
    <br/> out of the wood work everyday it seemed. Cellphones went from the size of Websters Dictonaries into things
    <br/> so small that at times seemed rather inconvientent. That was in the early 2000's. Then came 2007, the year
    <br/> of "Android". Oh Android, that beautiful open source goodness. In case you the reader whom ever you may be
    <br/> dont already know, open source is this thing, that basically means...anyone can work on it..free code boys
    <br/> and girls! YAY! So after the birth of Android, I decided to work on testing and buying mobile devices up
    <br/> the wazoo. From mobile PDA to things that only lasted a few months, each being consumed by me and sold for
    <br/> a little loss just so I could get my hands on the newest technology. Then came the day in 2012 that I bucked
    <br/> up and finally went back to school to persue my CSIS Degree and learn to code.
    <br/>
    <br/> Well as you probably have noticed if you have ever looked at code for the first time it looked like egyptian
    <br/> sandscrit when I first laid eyes on it. Then came the professors and youtube videos and books galore to help
    <br/> me decypher this alien langugage. Some beleive it is actually from aliens and if you work in the field long
    <br/> enough I'm sure you'll meet some Software Engineers that may possibly be from Mars. Yeah Software ninjas are
    <br/> a unique bunch but one thing you will notice is... they truly are...most of them the coolest, smartest, funnest
    <br/> people this side of universe!
    <br/>
    <br/> So what does this all mean and why do you care? Because you want to learn to code. Because when you wake up in
    <br/> morning you "KNOW" that you are meant for great things and that the future is yours to take a part of. Because
    <br/> YOU are the future and you are amazing. Best part of programming is that you can be in every field and don't
    <br/> have to stake your life on one field forever and turn into a mindless drone. You are, by learning to code,
    <br/> becoming a critical part of life as we know it and thats not all. Programming is in computers and computers are
    <br/> EVERYWHERE! Snowboarding? computers make those now, Fast cars? CPU's make you fast and furious, Humanitarian work?
    <br/> mobile phone apps are now being used to do eye exams on people in third world countries to help kids and adults
    <br/> alike see for the first time and have a chance at reading and seeing the world as an amazing things you are making
    <br/> better everyday! Pretty awesome right? Well if you've read this far and want me to point you to your future check
