    <!-- Making my nickname bold -->
    My Name is Jason<strong> "Jay" </strong>Green.
    <br/> My professional life started when I was 17 when I joined the United States Army
    <br/> and Utah Army National Guard as a member of the United States Army Corp of Engineers
    <br/> because I wanted to serve the country that had given me so much, most of
    <br/> this stemming from being brought up in a family of Special Operations
    <br/>members of the military. From the start I was placed into a specialized
    <br/> Community College of the Airforce in Texas that was comprised of members
    <br/> from all of the branches of the service including civilian instruction.
    <br/> My course of study was in the field of vertical engineering, water purification,
    <br/> environmental science and various other forms of engineering. I served humanitarian
    <br/> missions in Utah, Alaska and Japan during my service which made for a great feeling
    <br/> of accomplishment. In my personal life I never followed a path towards vertical
    <br/> engineering as I prefered to keep my service separate from my civilian side. I
    <br/> became a Security Force member as a contractor for the military, a science writer
    <br/> for two local Salt Lake City magazines for two years and found interest in teaching
    <br/> myself computer programming. After a 2 year residency in Santa Barbara California
    <br/> working for a defense contractor at Raytheon Electronic Warfare and Vision Systems
    <br/> I decided to move back to Utah and enroll in Salt Lake City Community College to begin
    <br/> my true passion in my professional career in Computer Science. I know, strange considering,
    <br/> my first career but nothing has made me happier for work than using my creativity, passion, and
    <br/> drive to figure technical things out to make the world of the future a reality today. Technology is
    <br/> AWESOME!

  <!-- Im also deleting  the word hoped just to show i know how to use del like the instructions ask -->
  <p>
    I have a very <b>strong</b> passion for programming and an aptitude for coding. "Every day is a
    <br/> day to figure out an exciting puzzle." is my motto when it comes to programming. I look
    <br/> forward to just about every task I have to figure out on a program and from my fellow
    <br/> students in my classes I can tell I made the right decision. Being able to know I can
    <br/> become one of the best in programming and the social structure of support in people that
    <br/> share my passion makes this adventure beyond amazing. It really is all about the team,
    <br/> the enviornment I work in and the passion that other share. I absolutely love my job at
    <br/>
    <a href="http://www.sorenson.com" style="color:#CCCC00"><em>Sorenson Communications</em></a> helping the deaf and hard of hearing communicate throughout the
    <br/> 50 states and it really has added to my spiritual, career and family life more than I could
    <br/> have ever <del>hoped</del> wished for.
