                  <em> In case you didn't already know, Tin foil hats protect you from the deadly mind control rays of the recticlian aliens from "Alpha Centari". Are you thinking of joining the fight against Zorn and the Codan Armada? Well, you may just want
                    to put down the tin foil and join the fight with the best protection this side of the "Malto-Meal" factory. DARPA, The US Militarys right arm for research, The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency has been working overtime over
                    this last year to come up with a solution to the problems tin foil represents to people. First its expensive in large quantites as it has to be mined. So what is the alternative that our geniuses behind closed doors, wearing white
                    lab coats have "baked" so to speak?
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Gluten-Free Tortilla Wraps.
                    </span>
                    <br>
                    <br> With these specialized wraps that you can make yourself from the common Grocery Store purchase, NOTHING and I mean NOTHING will protect you better than these Torilla wrapped tin foil hats. A Spokes person for Mission Tortillas, based
                    out of Suan Nuevo, Mexico says this, "When the ships come out of the sky and try to pull their sneaky tricks you can simply put one of our fresh tortillas on your head, wrap it in foil and make a run for it. Strangley enough when asked
                    about the increase and prices and sales of his famous "Envolturas mente extranjeros" translated "Alien Mind Wraps" Roberto Barrera had no comment. Feeling like you need the extra protection?
