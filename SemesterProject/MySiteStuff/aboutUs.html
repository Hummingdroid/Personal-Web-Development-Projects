                <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  <em> The Problem in todays crowd funded project sites is the lack of a focus. All one has to do is to visit any of the crowd funding sites and one is likely to be captured in a sea of possibilities. Unfortunately the sea of ideas is unfocused
                    and often times leads to sites that feel cluttered and without a focused goal. At Wearable-Now we hope to change that. By offering a single purpose, those who have a drive to support the people whom are trying to build the future of
                    our dreams today. At Wearable-Now, donators and inventors alike will now be able to peruse ideas with the singular focus of Wearable technology. From Contact lenses that provide users with a SMS Text based Heads Up Display, to Jackets
                    that can sense rainy weather and provide an extra level of water proofing without loosing breathability, from watches that can open your car door , to rings that can send a special pulse when someone's loved one wants to share a special
                    “heartbeat” love tap, to clothing that allows users to be seen while cycling, to clothing that helps automated drones provide Geo-Location tracking and emergency services to the wearer. The possibilities are endless, and by having
                    a more focused approach to crowd funded technological innovation, donators and inventors alike will drive the world of the future into Wearable-Now technology.

                    <br> At Wearable-Now, your donation will go towards only the projects you chose. 100% of the time. No hidden agendas. No distribution of your hard earned money towards projects you do not care about. With payment systems such as PayPal,
                    Bitcoin, and Google Pay, you will be able to instantly fund the project of your choice. What can you gain from donating to the next cool innovation? Most projects compensate donators with get an inside look at the creative process,
                    and help that project come to life. They also get to choose from a variety of unique rewards offered by the project creator. Rewards vary from project to project, but often include a copy of what is being produced (CD, DVD, book, etc.)
                    or an experience unique to the project. Project creators keep 100% ownership of their work, and Wearable-Now cannot be used to offer equity,financial returns,or to solicit loans.
