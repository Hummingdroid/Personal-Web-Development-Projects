        <h1>Description:</h1><br/>
        <h1>
          CSIS 1430 covered the use of the Internet & creating Websites. Topics included basic Internet applications & HTML, XHTML, CSS, XML, JavaScript & layout techniques. The Internet's social & legal impacts will also was studied. (The content of this course varies
          each semester as technology evolves.)<br/><br/></h1/><h1>Reflection:</h1><br/><h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1430 Course I originally had no idea of what to expect. I wanted to expand the way that I could design, understand and think about web development. I am by nature a strong language low
          level programmer and knew only a little bit about web development from various tutorials and online resources. Whe I started this course the familiar websites I was told to learn from were a gift. I quickly launched myself into the work. At
          times even the most simple design algorythm became complicated as I found my decision to start coding before really drawing out my thoughts kept me from real time valued returns. So I started to draw out my ideas.
          <br/><br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;I started to look at other websites and ask myself, "how can I do this better?". I knew that the designers of those websites were the creme of the crop in web design and were really familiar with things like boot-strap, php, advanced
          AngularJS and javascript and I was just a rookie in web development. I took the challange anyway. Now most of my studying brought me to the conclusion that I actually liked web dev.
          <br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;After a lot of trial and error and complicated ideas, I found that drawing the designs out and trying to reuse my code, in particular my CSS code that I could maximize my time and really work with my efforts instead of against them.
          I'm happy to say that this site and its following links will hopefully reflect my assumptions and new knowledge.
