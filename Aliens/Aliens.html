          <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; In case you didn't already know, Tin foil hats protect you from the deadly mind
                control rays of the recticlian aliens from "Alpha Centari". Are you
                thinking of joining the fight against Zorn and the Codan
                Armada? Well, you may just want to put down the tin foil and
                join the fight with the best protection this side of the
           <mark> "Malto-Meal" </mark> factory. DARPA, The US Militarys right arm for
                research, The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency has been
                working overtime over this last year to come up with a solution
                to the problems tin foil represents to people. First its
                expensive in large quantites as it has to be mined. So what is
                the alternative that our geniuses behind closed doors, wearing
                white lab coats have "baked" so to speak? <span style=
                "text-decoration: underline">Gluten-Free Tortilla
                Wraps.</span><br>
                <br>
                With these specialized wraps that you can make yourself from
                the common Grocery Store purchase, NOTHING and I mean NOTHING
                will protect you better than these Torilla wrapped tin foil hats. A Spokes person
                for Mission Tortillas, based out of Suan Nuevo, Mexico says this,
                "When the ships come out of the sky and try to pull their
                sneaky tricks you can simply put one of our fresh tortillas on
                your head, wrap it in foil and make a run for it. Strangley enough when asked
                about the increase and prices and sales of his famous
                "Envolturas mente extranjeros" translated "Alien Mind Wraps"
                Roberto Barrera had no comment. Feeling like you need the extra
                protection? <a href=
